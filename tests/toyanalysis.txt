Toy Analysis for dileptonic and semileptonic ttbar (via AR, MP etc)
* Loose Lepton selection (requires pt>20, an “Id Loose” flag, relative isolation < 0.25)
   * Both electrons and muons
* Jet select/cleaning against loose leptons , jet pt > 25 , jet id
* Compute event variables using selected cleaned jets
   * HT, HT+loose leptons, MHT
* Find opposite sign, same flavour pairs
   * Closest to Z
   * Highest pt pair
   * Highest mass pair
* Find opposite sign, opposite flavour pairs
   * Highest pt pair
   * Highest mass pair
* Find jj on W mass
   * Closest to W mass
   * Minimizing (Mjj-Mw)**2/(20)**2 + j1_btag+j2_btag (proxy for an actual likelihood) 
* Define B tagged jets
   * Tight tagged
   * Medium tagged
   * Leading, subleading btagged jet
* All triplets jjB 
   * Minimizing (Mjj-Mw)**2/(20)**2 + j1_btag+j2_btag -j3_btag
   * Minimizing mass diff to top nominal
* Tight leptons for trigger eff and signal/control region definition
   * pt>30 (fiducial region)
   * Id tight, rel iso < 0.15
* Trigger eff weight
   * From leading lepton pt (no trigger obj matching)
* Regions to be defined:
   * Signal Dile: 2 loose leptons, opposite charge
   * Signal Semi: 1 tight lepton, no second loose lepton, opposite charge
   * DY control: 2 tight, closest to Z within 10 GeV of nominal Z 
   * W+jet: 1 tight, no second loose, leading btag < medium OP
   * Some other top selection (e.g. good candidate for mass, loose/tight lept)
      * ???
* Systematics:
   * 50 JEC variations: no need for actual variations let’s scan from -25% to +25% with the 50 variations (steps of 1%)
   * JER: use TRand smearing
   * Mu Scale: up/down by 3%
   * Ele Scale: up/down by 3%
   * Btag weights x 10:
      * Compute eventBtagWeights for 10 different values of the individual jetweights (from 0.9 to 1.1 in steps of 0.02)
   * Lept eff weight
      * ???
* Histo to event weight
   * Trigger eff
   * Lepton eff
* Weight arrays
   * 100 PDF
   * 8 qcdscale
* Good runs/lumi selection
* Long “OR” Trigger bit selection (expanding from wildcards?)
* Output results (in multiple regions, with systematics):
   * Cutflow: all selections individually (if allowed by dependencies), sorted as in declaration down to signal region
   * Pt,eta for jets,leptons (tight and loose),W,Top cands(triples)
   * MHT, HT, MET, rho, tkmet, nPVs
   * Top and W mass in regions where it makes sense
   * Z(dilepton) mass in regions where it makes sense
   * N btags, N leptons
